# About The Project
#### Find My Pet is site for pet owners that have loss their family pet. Each year, approximately 10 million pets are lost in the United States, and millions of those end up in the nation's animal shelters. Tragically, only 15 percent of dogs and 2 percent of cats in shelters without ID tags or microchips are reunited with their owners. This gives the pet owner the ablitiy to post their missing pets to help in their search. The user will be able to save a post of the missing pet to revist on the their search to help find their pet or another users pet.
